## Excited to take this project for a spin your own way? Awesome! Here are a couple of quick things to keep in mind: 
- Let folks know where this project came from: A quick shoutout in your readme or documentaion to [joejoe135791/Eureka_Telegram_template](https://github.com/joejoe135791/Eureka_Telegram_template) and the original inspiration, [Carter-Labs-Ltd/telegram-template](https://github.com/Carter-Labs-Ltd/telegram-template), really helps spread the word and encourages more awesome projects!
  
- Keep it open and friendly: Just like this project, let yours stay open and accessible to everyone by using the same MIT license (or another similar open-source license). This keeps the good vibes flowing and lets everyone build on top of each other's work!
